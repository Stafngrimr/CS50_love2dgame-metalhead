# The LOVE Game

We're making a 2d story driven game about a metalhead who wakes up at a gig venue. All he can remember is that he came to a gig with some friends and they'd started having some drinks before the show.
Did he get drugged? Why is he in the bathroom? Where are his friends? What's going on?
Idunno, play it and find out.

This is my first time using LOVE/Lua, so it's a tester game and also my CS50 final project.
