# The LOVE Game

We're making a 2d story driven game about a metalhead who wakes up at a gig venue. All he can remember is that he came to a gig with some friends and they'd started having some drinks before the show.
Did he get drugged? Why is he in the bathroom? Where are his friends? What's going on?
Idunno, play it and find out.

This is my first time using LOVE/Lua, so it's a tester game and also my CS50 final project.

## Things to learn

- Create objects (bars, toilet stalls) that the player collides with, and stops them. Each room will be a different shape this way. SORT OF.
- Creation of other NPCs that move a bit around.. 

## Features to add
- Pause the game when focus has been lost.
- Beautifully painted backgrounds.
- An Intro/Title page, with start menu and etc.
- Music/Audio.
- The ability to save progress.
- Scrolling text as the story progresses.
