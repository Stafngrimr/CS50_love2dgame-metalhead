## What kind of game are we going to make?

There are going to be 6 rooms.

You wake up disoriented in the first room. You're not sure how you arrived and you think you passed out from being drunk or maybe someone spiked your drink??

You remember getting to the venue and not much else past that.. You look around and you're in the toilet actually. How on earth did I get in here. I think I locked myself in.. 

Better find the key..

(pickup the key)
Ah, there's the key. I can get out of here finally.
